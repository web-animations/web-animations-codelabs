    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
At Google, we're striving to power our company with 100% renewable energy. In addition to the environmental benefits, we see renewable energy as a business opportunity and continue to invest in accelerating its development. We believe that by helping power more of the world with renewable energy, we're creating a better future for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
We're currently using renewable energy to power 35% of our operations, and we continue to look for ways to increase our use of clean energy. This includes trying new, innovative technology at our offices and buying green power near our data centers.

We're currently using renewable energy to power 35% of our operations, and we continue to look for ways to increase our use of clean energy. This includes trying new, innovative technology at our offices and buying green power near our data centers.
    </p>
    <p>
When testing new renewable energy technologies on our campuses, we evaluate them against a few criteria: They must make good business sense, have potential for long-term significant impact and transform the industry. For example, in 2007, we installed the largest corporate solar panel installation of its kind &mdash; 1.7 MW &mdash; at our Mountain View campus. We've grown the size of the system to 1.9 MW, and it generates enough electricity to power 30% of the peak load of the buildings on which it sits.
    </p>
    <p>
Currently, very little of the world's power is from renewables like wind and solar. We're working on changing that by buying electricity directly from wind farms near our data centers. We're also working with our utility partners to find solutions that will make more renewable energy available for us and for others. All of these initiatives help us get clean energy at competitive prices and the wind farm owners get the money they need to build these projects and/or finance additional clean energy facilities. Together we make the grid a little bit greener.
